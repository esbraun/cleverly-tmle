# Roadmap

This is the single planning contract for `cleverly`. It contains proposed work only. Implemented
capabilities belong in the [user guide](user-guide/index.md), scientific contracts in the
[technical reference](technical-reference/index.md) and [DR-TMLE contract](technical-reference/dr-tmle/index.md), validation results in
[evidence manifest](technical-reference/evidence.md), and cross-module standing decisions in the
[architecture invariants](architecture-invariants.md).

The main grid is one binding sequence. Complete lower numbers before higher numbers. Items with no
published theory do not enter this sequence.

## Future investigations

These items are hard stops. Move one into the main roadmap only after a published paper supplies
the missing result. Package code and a related estimator do not remove the stop.

| investigation | missing published result | current boundary | details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Other refused C-TMLE and DR-TMLE compositions | composition-specific score, reduced regressions, correction, remainder, and rate conditions | named pre-fit refusals and conditional-on-weight intervals remain | [F5](#f5-other-refused-c-tmle-and-dr-tmle-compositions) |
| MNAR and incremental-intermediate compositions | identification and influence-function results for the exact compositions | point-treatment sensitivity and implemented interventions remain separate | [F6](#f6-mnar-and-incremental-intermediate-compositions) |
| Time-respecting cross-fitting | dependence and split-specific TMLE inference for blocked-temporal or rolling-origin folds | iid and grouped cross-fitting only | [F7](#f7-time-respecting-cross-fitting) |

## Eligibility

`cleverly` implements established statistical methods; it does not use a package feature as the
place to invent one. A scientific feature enters implementation only when a published derivation
covers the estimand and requested inference regime. A new estimator or composition requires an
identified parameter, its influence function, the targeting or estimating equations, and the
remainder and rate conditions needed for the claimed interval. If one is absent, the item is to
locate published theory, not create it here.

A canonical public implementation is valuable provenance for control flow, data layout, and named
conventions, but it is not acceptance evidence by itself. Where code and paper disagree, the
published derivation governs and the discrepancy becomes a nonzero regression or mutation test.

The readiness labels rate published-method support, not programming effort:

- **published support**: a paper derives the method and inference claim;
- **source audit**: a published paper appears to cover it, but the exact construction must be
  matched and discrepancies resolved before implementation;
- **theory-neutral**: engineering that preserves an already-derived estimator;
- **waiting on published theory**: related methods exist, but not the requested composition or
  inference claim; it belongs only in the future investigations grid; and
- **pending source read**: the governing result is identified but has not been read first-hand
  into this package's contract.

## Definition of done

An item is complete only when all applicable conditions hold:

- the estimand is registered and covered in both directions by the oracle and evidence gates in
  `tests/unit/test_registry.py`, with an [evidence](technical-reference/evidence.md) row naming
  which instruments check its influence curve and which mistakes none can see;
- every well-posed composition still refused has a pre-fit test pinning the refusal and message;
- signs, masks, guards, and counterfactual blocks that can vanish at truth have a nonzero witness
  or deliberate-mutation control in addition to exact-law checks;
- cross-module changes satisfy [the architecture invariants](architecture-invariants.md);
- reader-facing behavior, migration, methodology, references, and evidence are updated without
  presenting a proposal as a release claim; and
- every relevant check has run locally and GitHub Actions is green. CI is the final merge signal,
  not a substitute for the local validation record.

## Sensitivity and validation priority

The [implementation validation grid](technical-reference/method-evidence/validation-grid.md)
records completed studies. Replicate-weight designs are the next source-audit item. Implement them
only after that audit supports the planned variance construction. Longitudinal sensitivity-bound
estimation remains in [F16](#f16-longitudinal-sensitivity-bound-estimation).

## Detailed implementation contracts

The sections below group contracts by subsystem. Their physical order does not override the main
grid.

### P1. EP learner

Van der Laan, Carone and Luedtke (2024), arXiv:2402.01972, govern this item. After first-hand
review of their EP derivation, add `ConditionalContrast` estimands, modifier schema, sieve/basis
strategy, efficient plug-in risk and targeting, bounded outcome predictions, a second-stage
contrast learner, out-of-fold risk/calibration, and a conditional prediction result. Reuse
study/identification objects, nuisance strategies, folds, data backends, provenance, persistence,
and capability-aware assessment.

The first catalog is paper-derived CATE and conditional relative risk. Other losses and contrasts
require their own derivations. Aggregating an EP curve is a separate parameter and receives scalar
inference only after its influence contribution is implemented and tested.

Acceptance requires exact score and risk checks, bounded predictions, out-of-fold calibration,
modifier and split/basis stability diagnostics, mutation controls for targeting sign, basis
contribution, and contrast construction, plus registered oracle-efficiency and stability studies.

### R1. Nested Riesz engine and initial catalog

#### Purpose and scientific boundary

Add the general nested Riesz engine as one scientific review unit. Direct Riesz learning replaces
the analytic construction of a representer from propensity or density components; it does not
generally replace the outcome regression. The single-stage form remains a plug-in term plus
`alpha * (Y - f)`. Engine expressibility is not permission to register a causal target.

The governing nested-TMLE source is Balkus, Testa & Hejazi (2026), arXiv:2604.21721v1: Theorems
1–2, Algorithm 1, and Sections 4 and 5. Chernozhukov, Newey & Singh (2022), Econometrica 90(3),
governs the direct representer moment problem and product-bias identity. RieszCML is pinned only as
secondary implementation evidence; paper/code discrepancies must be recorded and tested.

Stages are stored **innermost first**, matching the order the backward recursion *executes* in.
Two nearby orderings run the other way and neither is the storage convention. Theorem 2 indexes
outermost first, so the paper's *prefix* product is a *suffix* product here:

```text
paper order:       outer 1, ..., inner T
stored order:      inner 0, ..., outer J-1
```

And `longitudinal/sequential.py` reverses its steps before returning them, so the stored
`SequentialStep` tuple is time-ascending. `steps[0]` is the outermost stage whose targeted
prediction is averaged into the estimate. Do not mirror it. Every public description, serialized
manifest, fixture, and diagnostic names the storage direction.

#### Contracts and public surface

Introduce immutable advanced contracts under a Riesz namespace.

| contract | what it declares |
| --- | --- |
| `FunctionalStage` | the regression, plug-in map, representer problem, intervention evaluation, residual source, identification metadata, targeting map, stage name, and history |
| `NestedFunctional` | ordered stages, evidence ID, output shape, parameter key, and causal metadata |
| `AnalyticRepresenter`, `DirectRiesz`, `ProvidedRepresenter`, internal `ComposedRepresenter` | the mechanism-derived, directly learned, externally supplied, and cumulative stagewise representers |
| fitted stage artifacts | observed and intervention regression predictions, `alpha`, `alpha_star`, component and cumulative products, residual sources, masks, folds, targeting coefficients, losses, balance diagnostics, row identity, and training provenance |
| `RieszTMLEMethod` | a scalar `RieszResult` satisfying `CausalResult` and the shared inference, contrast, identification, assessment, persistence, and provenance protocols |

A custom statistical functional may use `NestedFunctional`. Causal prose and intervals need a
registered evidence ID and a complete influence construction. `RieszTMLEMethod` never fabricates a
propensity object for a direct fit.

A provided representer must establish row identity, folds, training provenance, and
counterfactual evaluation. Missing `alpha_star` is refused rather than replaced by observed
`alpha`. Built-in estimands construct stages internally; advanced custom builders validate roles,
shapes, histories, intervention evaluation, and identification metadata before fitting.

#### Folds, fitting, and targeting

Use one validated outer fold plan for regression and representer fits. Each row is predicted only
by models not trained on it; learner tuning remains inside the outer training fold; supplied folds
must prove coverage, disjointness, grouping, cluster integrity, and row identity. Independent
nuisance folds remain unavailable until their theory and diagnostic implications are specified.

For stored stages `0..J-1`, innermost first, construct:

```text
omega_observed[j] = product(alpha[k], k=j..J-1)
omega_plugin[j]   = alpha_star[j] * product(alpha[k], k=j+1..J-1)
```

The plug-in product changes only the current stage to its intervention state; it is not a product
of every `alpha_star`. Store all components separately. Fit initial regressions from the observed
outcome outward, fit or construct each stage's observed and intervention representers on the same
training fold, and pass each plug-in output outward as the next target.

A direct strategy solves an explicit empirical Riesz moment problem. A generic supervised
regression of an estimated inverse propensity score is not a direct-Riesz implementation and is
not labelled one. It is the nearest wrong construction, and it fits and predicts without
complaint.

Target innermost first. Solve the fluctuation with `omega_observed[j]`, update observed predictions
with that product and plug-in predictions with `omega_plugin[j]`, and pass the targeted plug-in
outward. Identity and logistic fluctuations are supported initially. Logistic targeting requires
a validated scaler and preserved bounds; a degenerate direction raises `CleverlyError`.

The targeted uncentered curve is:

```text
outermost_targeted_plugin
+ sum_j omega_observed[j] * (
      targeted_residual_source[j] - targeted_observed_regression[j]
  )
```

Center it at the targeted plug-in estimate, then apply declared Hájek weights, outcome scaling,
cluster aggregation, covariance, smooth contrasts, and simultaneous inference through existing
infrastructure. Recompute stage scores and the complete influence-curve mean from stored arrays.
Do not use an untargeted curve for a targeted estimate's standard error.

Repeated splitting follows only after a single split is correct. Take marginal medians over
repeats with the registered split-dispersion variance. Retain repeat IDs on artifacts. Refuse joint
covariance where coordinatewise medians break identities. Reject equal-fold averaging with an
unequal-fold-size test.

#### Initial catalog and refusals

The implementation PR must support each initial cell with full evidence or retain its named
pre-fit refusal.

| typed estimand or design | analytic Riesz | direct Riesz | decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| point `CounterfactualMean` | yes | yes | canonical single-stage functional |
| point `ATE` | yes | yes | joint contrast of counterfactual means |
| point `RiskRatio` and `OddsRatio` | yes | yes | existing joint delta method; binary outcome only |
| point outcome missing at random | yes | yes | missingness stage composed with each treatment-specific mean |
| longitudinal static and dynamic `RegimeMean` | yes | yes | evidenced sequential instances after history and arm mutations pass |
| longitudinal `RegimeContrast` | yes | yes | joint contrast of evidenced regimen means |
| point `ModifiedTreatmentPolicy` | yes | yes | evidenced invertible policies with target-specific moment map |
| smooth contrasts of initial rows | yes | yes | existing delta-method infrastructure |
| `ATT` and `ATC` | gated | gated | ratio or conditional-functional stage and variance audit required |
| `NaturalCourseMean`, `PopulationAttributableRisk`, and `PopulationAttributableFraction` | gated | gated | composition and parameter-key audit required |
| one-point stochastic `RegimeMean` | gated | gated | density-valued direct-loss audit required |
| `IncrementalMean` and `IncrementalEffect` | refused | refused | intervention depends on the treatment mechanism |
| point or longitudinal `MSMProjection` | gated | gated | target-specific projection and coefficient-EIF adapter required |
| mediation and `ControlledDirectEffect` | refused | refused | outside the first catalog |
| survival and competing-risk results | refused | refused | separate at-risk/event audit required |
| arbitrary custom nonlinear functional | refused as causal | refused as causal | statistical label only after validation |

Analytic Riesz is the existing evidenced mechanism-derived estimator expressed through the new
contract. Its gate is identity with the normalized existing engine for targeted predictions,
influence curve, standard error, and interval. Point estimate parity alone is insufficient.

#### Diagnostics and persistence

Default cheap validation covers stage scores, influence-curve mean, direct objective improvement,
held-out moments, representer tails and leverage, regression loss, and fold/provenance integrity.
Analytic fits may report mechanisms and truncation; direct fits report representer loss, balance,
tails, leverage, regularization, and clipping; composed fits report components and products.
Direct-only fits must not reconstruct a propensity model for diagnostics or sensitivity.

Increment the persistence format. Store ordered stage definitions and evidence IDs, every fitted
array, reconstructible strategy configuration, fingerprints, settings, structured identification
and parameter keys, cached reports, and replayability. Unknown types fail allowlist decoding.
Custom callables are descriptive and non-reconstructible; cache-only operations remain possible
only when stored predictions and provenance suffice. Losing `alpha_star`, stage order, or component
products is a load error. Round trips compare every artifact, score, diagnostic, estimate,
influence curve, metadata record, and cached assessment.

#### Evidence and implementation sequence

Every registered functional needs the full instrument set. That is exact finite-support laws,
Gateaux derivatives, and product remainders with both nuisance errors nonzero. It is also score
checks, union-model witnesses where derived, and nonzero targeting. The mutations are sign,
`alpha_star`, stage and product order, mask, and counterfactual. Leakage spies, analytic
regressions, and a pinned secondary fixture complete it.
Direct fits additionally require loss improvement, held-out moments, same-fold observed and
intervention predictions, provenance, and extreme-representer diagnostic response.

Nested evidence uses nonconstant two- and three-stage laws and rejects reversed stages, reversed
products, all-starred products, wrong signs, and masks. Missingness evidence makes observation
depend on treatment/history and proves unobserved rows receive the correct plug-in update.
Longitudinal evidence covers dynamic-history restriction, third-arm categorical mutations,
treatment/censoring products, clusters, repeats, and persistence. Registered studies cover point
means/ATE under both union-model halves, direct consistency and coverage, static/dynamic regimen
means, and weak overlap with thresholds fixed before the final run.

Implement in one review PR with gated commits: contracts and pre-fit refusals; analytic
single-stage parity; direct single-stage learning; nested and missingness composition;
longitudinal adapters; then persistence, assessment, documentation, and the secondary fixture. No
commit merges independently. Handoff requires the enabled/refused catalog, source locators,
implementation revision and discrepancies, evidence instruments, local commands/results, and
path-based reasons for omitted validation studies.

### R2. Evidence-gated Riesz catalog expansion

Expand target by target after the engine lands. Mediation, additional longitudinal targets,
sampling designs, and other nested functionals each require a governing derivation, typed adapter,
registry entry, evidence row, refusal boundary, documentation, and applicable statistical study.
Do not expose a generic engine capability as a certified causal estimand.

### F8. Multi-arm simulated-confounding stress surface

The cited DoWhy papers support a qualitative stress analysis. They do not define a multi-arm
treatment perturbation. The pinned implementation supports a binary tail flip and a continuous
linear change only. It has no category-valued branch.

Hu et al. (2022), DOI 10.1214/21-AOAS1530, keep treatment fixed and adjust outcomes through
directional confounding functions. That method does not supply the category-valued refit law that
this surface needs. A pairwise label swap or a map over numeric arm codes would therefore be a new
scientific construction.

Wait for a published law that maps a shared latent variable and a $K$-level treatment to the same
declared support. The law must name the assessed contrast, remain invariant to label order, and
define the achieved treatment-confounder association. Until then, retain the multi-arm pre-fit
refusal. Do not reuse a binary flip by choosing two arm codes.

### F9. Clustered simulated-confounding stress surface

The pinned DoWhy implementation draws one independent latent value per row. It does not accept a
cluster identifier or define a cluster-level perturbation. Pinned `lmtp` preserves identifiers in
folds and inference, but it does not define a simulated-common-cause surface.

Ou, Tang and Chang (2023), arXiv:2301.12396v1, model unmeasured cluster effects through mixed
models and derive a different bias correction. Their construction does not perturb treatment and
outcome before a complete TMLE refit. It does not choose between row-level, cluster-level, and
mixed latent causes for this surface.

Wait for a published or canonical construction that defines that choice and its interpretation.
Until then, retain the clustered pre-fit refusal. Do not infer a shared cluster draw from grouped
folds or cluster-robust variance, because those contracts govern estimator dependence only.

### F10. Logical categorical confounder calibration

The pinned DoWhy implementation calibrates one encoded coordinate at a time. Its
[calibration helpers, lines 213-340](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy/blob/2116d5cbace5a057937e03b2efba95c13140cc4c/dowhy/causal_refuters/add_unobserved_common_cause.py#L213-L340)
hold both rules. The binary rule zeros one standardized column. The continuous rule uses one
column's correlation times the perturbed variable's standard deviation. Neither rule defines a
whole categorical covariate on the same scale.

Wait for a source that maps a logical categorical covariate to binary flip probabilities or signed
continuous perturbation strengths. The benchmark must state how labels, reference levels, and
multiple encoded columns affect it. A coefficient norm, grouped deletion, or permutation score
does not supply that mapping by itself. Keep the categorical refusal before every random draw
and refit until this contract exists.

### F11. Estimated-weight simulated-confounding replay

The fitted result stores estimated weights but not the model that produced them. Replay also needs
the target population and the variables that the model can read after perturbation.

Hartman and Huang (2024) bound bias from an omitted variable in survey weights. Their method does
not define weight regeneration inside this refit surface. Wait for a source-backed regeneration
rule, then store enough model provenance to reproduce it. The rule must state whether the latent
cause enters the weight model and which population each cell targets.

### F12. Missing-outcome simulated-confounding replay

The pinned DoWhy refuter perturbs treatment and outcome only. It defines no replacement law for the
response indicator. Díaz and van der Laan (2017) define randomized missing-outcome DR-TMLE under
missing at random. They do not define this diagnostic's joint perturbation law.

Do not hold the response indicator fixed. A treatment perturbation can break missing at random
conditional on the perturbed treatment. Wait for a joint observation, treatment, and outcome law
with identified refit semantics. The law must cover ordinary TMLE and the randomized missing-outcome
DR-TMLE construction separately.

### F13. Longitudinal simulated-confounding replay

The pinned DoWhy law is a single-time-point perturbation. It does not define shared latent causes
across treatment, censoring, history, and outcome nodes. Tan (2025) supplies longitudinal
sensitivity bounds, not a complete-refit perturbation surface.

Wait for a time-indexed latent law that preserves temporal order and names the assessed contrast.
It must define each node's perturbation, history update, censoring behavior, and induced association.

### F15. Controlled-direct-effect simulated-confounding replay

A controlled direct effect orders treatment, intermediate, observation, and outcome mechanisms.
The pinned DoWhy law has no intermediate branch and no contrast rule for a fixed intermediate.

Wait for a source-backed latent law that respects this order. The law must define each perturbed
mechanism, the response indicator, and the controlled contrast before complete refits can begin.

### F16. Longitudinal sensitivity-bound estimation

Tan (2025) studies population sensitivity bounds for terminal outcomes under binary, static
longitudinal strategies. The paper keeps its primary, joint, and product sensitivity models
separate. The primary and joint models have the same sharp population mean bounds. The general
product-model representations are conservative, except in the restricted cases the paper states.
The formal simultaneous-attainment results for sharp treatment contrasts cover two periods. The
paper excludes dynamic strategies.

The paper sketches sample analogues under linear parameterizations and consistent transformed ICE
or IPW estimation. It also gives restricted computations through weighted quantile regression.
It leaves a complete general estimator, specialized algorithms, nuisance approximation theory,
and sampling inference to future work. Wait for published results that supply those contracts
before adding a sample-data operation. The shipped longitudinal surface continues to refuse
point-treatment sensitivity formulas and reports only its derived stagewise diagnostics.

## Longitudinal contracts

The four core LTMLE evidence rows are implemented and registered in the
[validation grid](technical-reference/method-evidence/validation-grid.md). They separate
end-of-study and survival parameters from ordinary and cross-fitted nuisance estimation. The
remaining items below are proposed extensions to that core.

### F1. Stochastic categorical policies at a longitudinal node

The implemented surface assigns one category per unit. A distribution-valued policy changes the
intervention density and replaces selected probabilities with cumulative density ratios.
Implementation waits for published identification, longitudinal influence function, remainder,
and interval rate conditions; a point-treatment stochastic regime is not sufficient evidence.

### F2. Targeted bootstrap inference

Wait for a source specifying what is fixed, resampled, refitted, and retargeted and which sampling
law the interval estimates. Resampling stored curves, retargeting cached arrays, and refitting the
complete estimator are distinct procedures and must not be inferred from the name.

### F3. Additional longitudinal estimands

Competing-event interventions and other longitudinal estimands wait for their own identification
assumptions, influence functions, targeting construction, and inference conditions. Add accepted
targets in both directions to the oracle registry and evidence gates rather than treating them as
options on an existing cause-specific estimand.

### F7. Time-respecting cross-fitting

Blocked-temporal and rolling-origin folds wait for a published TMLE result whose dependence
assumptions match the supported data. The result must specify which rows may train each prediction
and which asymptotic argument licenses the interval. Ordered indices passed through iid fold
machinery are not sufficient.

## DR-TMLE investigation contracts

### F4. Multi-arm missing-outcome DR-TMLE

`delta=` under `guard=("Q", "g")` continues to refuse more than two treatment arms. Díaz and van
der Laan's missing-outcome theorem is binary and does not provide arm-indexed observation,
treatment, and outcome correction blocks. Begin only when a source supplies the multi-arm
corrected influence curve, remainder, and rate conditions. Existing binary evidence is the
regression surface the extension must preserve.

### F5. Other refused C-TMLE and DR-TMLE compositions

Continue pre-fit refusals for ATT, ATC, PAR, PAF, regimes, incremental interventions, shifts, MSMs,
mediation, and missing treatment where each variant lacks evidence. Ordinary-TMLE implementations do
not establish collaborative or doubly robust inference for these compositions.

Each C-TMLE extension needs its target-specific collaborative score and selection-risk contract.
Each DR-TMLE extension needs reduced regressions, a correction, a remainder, and rate conditions.
PAR and PAF also need the joint observed-mean curve and covariance. Complete simulated-confounding
replay receives its own audit only after the estimator can fit the target.

An estimated-weight DR-TMLE fit is not refused. Its interval conditions on the supplied weights.
An unconditional interval claim needs the influence contribution from weight estimation. This
inference gap is separate from F11, which tracks weight-model replay after a perturbation.

## Other extension and investigation contracts

### X2. Replicate-weight designs

Rust and Rao (1996) govern replication variance for complex surveys. Add BRR, jackknife, or
another replicate design only after a source audit matches its construction to this package's
weighted-law estimands and inference conventions.

### F6. MNAR and incremental-intermediate compositions

An MNAR tilt for continuous-dose shifts and intermediate variables with incremental interventions
wait for identification and influence-function results covering those exact compositions.

The four items below add methods rather than studies. Each item names the maintained implementation
that a paired study would use. A named comparator is provenance for the construction. It is not the
derivation, and it is not the acceptance gate.

### X4. Sequential doubly robust longitudinal estimation

`lmtp_sdr` implements the sequentially doubly robust estimator of Díaz, Williams, Hoffman and
Schenck (2023). That estimator is consistent when either the outcome regression or the treatment
mechanism is consistent at each time point. It is a second estimator over registered longitudinal
targets, so it adds no estimand. The comparator is the pinned R `lmtp` 1.5.4 that the longitudinal
rows already use, and no new container is needed. Read the rate conditions its interval claims
first, because they differ from the sequential regression conditions.

### X5. Natural and interventional mediation effects

`cleverly` reports controlled direct effects only. Natural and interventional direct and indirect
effects are separate estimands, and each carries its own identification assumptions. Díaz, Hejazi,
Rudolph and van der Laan (2021) derive the interventional effects and their efficient influence
function under an intermediate confounder. R `medoutcon` implements a cross-fitted one-step
estimator and a cross-validated TMLE for them, and it pins by commit. Read the identification, the
influence function, the targeting construction, and the interval conditions first-hand. Add each
accepted target to the oracle registry and the evidence gates in both directions.

### X6. Continuous-time survival and competing risks

The shipped survival and competing-risk estimators use discrete time nodes. Rytgaard, Gerds and van
der Laan (2022) derive the continuous-time construction, which changes the intensity model, the
targeting step, and the remainder. CRAN `concrete` 1.0.5 is the comparator, and it implements the
one-step form of Rytgaard, Eriksson and van der Laan (2023).

That comparator takes a binary baseline treatment under a static or dynamic intervention, which
bounds the paired cells a first study can claim. A discrete-time study is not evidence for a
continuous-time interval, so the existing longitudinal rows do not transfer.

### X7. Two-phase and outcome-dependent sampling

A two-phase design measures some variables on a subsample only. An outcome-dependent design samples
on the outcome itself. Each design changes the observed-data likelihood, so each needs its own
influence-function correction.

Hejazi, van der Laan, Janes, Gilbert and Benkeser (2021) derive the
two-phase correction, and R `txshift` 0.3.8 implements it. Van der Laan (2008) derives case-control
weighting under a known prevalence. Fixed observation weights do not replace either correction.
The comparator survey rejects `txshift` as a second opinion on
continuous shifts. That verdict does not carry here, because the two-phase correction is a
different feature.

### X8. Stratified incremental and MSM targeting

Ordinary TMLE refuses stratified incremental targets and stratified nonlinear or continuous MSMs.
DR-TMLE refuses a baseline stratum, because its reduced regressions add a second targeting equation
for the `mean` group. Each estimator raises `NotImplementedError` during the fit. A post-fit
surface cannot repair these upstream estimator limits.

This item is unwritten work rather than a hard stop. Each parameter is well posed, and the package
already fluctuates baseline strata for arm, regime, and shift targets. The refusal taxonomy records
each row as [not written yet](technical-reference/scope-and-refusals.md#not-written-yet).

Match the stratum-indexed targeting construction to a published derivation before implementation.
Continuous MSMs also need dose-indexed strata semantics. Add the targeting equations and their
validation evidence next. Complete simulated-confounding replay receives its own audit last.

## Reading a gap correctly

Not every absence is missing package functionality. The refusal taxonomy in
[How to read a refusal](technical-reference/scope-and-refusals.md#how-to-read-a-refusal) distinguishes an unimplemented
well-posed feature from a different causal question and a method that would be wrong by
