# Collaborative TMLE

## What this solves

You have many measured covariates and you do not know which ones matter. Some are confounders. Some
are instruments: they predict the treatment strongly and do not affect the outcome. Putting an
instrument into the propensity model is not a neutral act. It makes the propensity extreme, which
makes the clever covariate large, which inflates the variance without removing any bias.

A propensity model chosen by predictive loss will happily include an instrument, because an
instrument is exactly what predicts treatment best. Collaborative TMLE chooses the treatment
mechanism against the *target parameter* instead.

| your situation | what this method buys | what it costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a large adjustment set with unknown structure | a treatment mechanism selected by cross-validated loss on the targeted estimate, so an instrument is left out | one nuisance fit per candidate along the selection path, on top of cross-fitting |
| near-positivity failure driven by strong treatment predictors | a less adaptive mechanism when the data says a less adaptive one estimates better | selection is data-dependent, and the reported interval does not account for it |
| the outcome regression is already good | the *empty* propensity model is a legitimate choice, and the selector will make it | that is not evidence the search discriminates. See the validation section |

Reach for a different entry when your worry is the *inference* rather than the *selection*
([DR-TMLE](dr-tmle.md)), or when the adjustment set is small and you would include all of it
([point-treatment TMLE](point-treatment-tmle.md)).

Collaborative TMLE is available for point-treatment, arm-axis fits whose target is `ate`, `ey`,
`ey1`, `ey0`, `rr`, or `or`. It has no longitudinal derivation, and `available_methods()` says so
before any model is fitted.

A worked applied analysis is in the
[collaborative TMLE tutorial](../examples/collaborative-tmle.md). It shows both the
comparison that discriminates and the one that does not.

The selector does not identify a causal adjustment set. Establish the eligible baseline set from
the study design before the selector chooses an assignment nuisance model.

## The algorithm as implemented

The implementation follows the published pooled construction step by step.

| paper operation | implementation invariant | how it is validated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| build increasingly adaptive candidates | the greedy, preordered, and discrete paths retain nested candidate state | exact path and treatment-risk tests |
| target the outcome regression with each candidate | every candidate carries its complete targeted regression, its fluctuation, and its influence curve | longhand loss, penalty, and score equations |
| cross-validate the stopping index | every selection fold refits the outcome regression, the auxiliary mechanisms, and every candidate. Training-row predictions are inner-fold out of fold, and validation-row predictions come from the full selection-training fit | row-identity spy learners, and the two-fold degeneracy case |
| select the candidate estimator | the final fit persists both the selected mechanism and the selected targeted regression | a mutation test in which discarding the targeted regression fails |
| report and retarget | pooled targeting continues from the selected state, and the continuation score is numerically zero | score, sensitivity, and serialization round trips |

**Selection folds are separate from nuisance cross-fitting.** Inside each selection-training set, a
dedicated inner split produces out-of-fold predictions for its training rows, and one additional
model trained on the whole set predicts the selection-validation rows. Matching fold counts or
seeds is never relied on for independence. A selection-validation observation or cluster
contributes to no nuisance fit used to score it, and no training row contributes to the model that
predicts that row. The outcome support transform is fixed from the outer fit, so every fold's loss
and influence curve stay in the same unit.

**Selection is joint across arms.** With `K` arms, every candidate is one `n x K` categorical
mechanism, and the mean fluctuation solves all `K` arm equations. For curve matrix `D` the penalty
is

$$
\operatorname{trace}(\operatorname{cov}(D)) + n \lVert \operatorname{mean}(D) \rVert^2 ,
$$

so no contrast is privileged by its position. `ey` contributes all `K` arm curves. `ate`, `rr`, and
`or` contribute all `K - 1` curves against the reference. `CTMLESelection.target_names` records the
exact vector that was optimized.

## Variations

| option | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `strategy="greedy"` | the package's scalable candidate path. The default |
| `strategy="ordered"` | both scalable preorders from Ju et al. (2019). `preorder="logistic"` uses one-variable targeting loss and is the default. `preorder="partial_correlation"` conditions the residual-covariate correlation on one-hot treatment indicators rather than on numeric arm codes. Marginal correlation with the outcome is not a published preorder and is not used |
| `strategy="discrete"` | selection among explicitly supplied candidate covariate sets |
| `strategy="oat"` | the outcome-adaptive categorical mechanism of the archived `ctmle3`, fitted on the matrix of arm-specific outcome predictions. It has no candidate path and no parameter-specific selector |
| `candidates=`, `ordering=` | supply the candidate sets or the preorder explicitly |
| `selection_folds=` | folds for the stopping-index cross-validation. Default 5 |
| `selection_inner_folds=` | the explicit cost control. Default 2, so a selection path uses three fits per nuisance or candidate rather than silently borrowing the outer nuisance fold count |
| `loss=`, `penalty=` | the selection loss, and whether the variance-plus-squared-mean penalty is applied |
| `selection_estimand=` | which parameter vector the selection optimizes |

**Only the pooled collaborative estimator is exposed.** `targeting_scheme="fold"` and
`cv_evaluation=True` are refused. Composing collaborative model selection with fold-targeted or
canonical CV-TMLE changes the estimator and needs a separate derivation.

**Retargeting holds the selection fixed.** A sensitivity analysis begins each perturbed targeting
step from the selected candidate's own targeted regression, not from the initial one. Both the
iterative and the one-step sweeps are checked to solve the perturbed score. Rerun the fit to redo
selection.

**`CTMLE` on an `incremental=` fit is wrong by construction**, not a gap. Each candidate mechanism
defines a different estimand, so the search would select between estimands rather than between
estimators.

## Validation issues special to this method

**A favourable comparison against plain TMLE can be won by a selector that selects nothing.** When
the outcome regression is correctly specified, the *empty* propensity model is a legitimate
mean-squared-error-minimising choice, and the ordered selector makes it on all five fixed
`n = 700` unit-test seeds. That is right rather than a defect. It also means such a comparison is
not evidence that the search discriminates between covariates.

The claim that it does discriminate is therefore tested where selecting nothing is *wrong*. With
the outcome model reduced to a constant, the search includes the confounder in every seed and still
leaves the instrument out. A do-nothing selector has mean absolute error 0.696 there, against
0.017.

**No R package implements the same complete selector.** `tmle3` is a design reference for the
shared out-of-fold-nuisance and pooled-fluctuation architecture, and it localises the convention
that training rows use fold fits while new rows use a full-training refit. It does not implement
C-TMLE selection. The candidate search is therefore accepted on the paper equations, the exact
identities, the row-membership audits, the mutation controls, the score checks, and the registered
studies. It is not accepted on numerical R parity.

**Scoring only one contrast is a load-bearing mutation.** The multi-arm selector's joint penalty is
checked by a mutation that scores only the first contrast. It changes the penalty by more than 100.

**The interval does not price the selection.** Inference remains the ordinary cross-fitted TMLE
contract: positivity, and an $o_p(n^{-1/2})$ nuisance-product remainder. The original C-TMLE
theorem describes an additional adaptive-mechanism influence contribution, for stronger inference
when both nuisance limits can be wrong. R `ctmle` implements a binary parametric delta-method
version of it. There is no validated selected-multinomial counterpart here, so `cleverly` does not
claim collaborative-double-robust coverage for these intervals.
